# CPUSim
A CPU Simulator of a simple novel 8-bit architecture written in C++ with Qt
# About
CPUSim was my A-level computing project (2013). It features several odd design choices in order to meet the project rubric and mark scheme such as excessive use of OOP and exceptions, regular expressions for assembling, included GUI, and lambda functions.

The project hasn't been touched since 2013 so is unlikely to receive any updates and is not guaranteed to work.
